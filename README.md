# CWU-MET-code

This repository contains sample programs for the CWU MET courses and CWU MET High School Robotics program.  These programs are written in VEXcode V5 block mode, to demonstrate various concepts on how to control the robot students maybe designing to the posed challenges. Key to both programs is the concept of drive base / robot deviation testing, or determining how straight my robot will drive, does illuminating the mechanical build quality of the chassis.

Deviation Sample Programs:

deviationDrivetrain.v5blocks    -- drivetrain object based single motor sample test project
deviationTwoMotor.v5blocks      -- drive base with single left and right motor sample project
deviationMotorGroup.v5blocks    -- drive base using two or more motors per side configured using motorgroup

Sample Robot Subsystem Programs:

tankDrive.v5blocks              -- sample program to operate the robot in tankdrive mode

Competition Template Sample programs:

COMPtemplate01.v5blocks         -- Sample setup of the competition template for the robot
